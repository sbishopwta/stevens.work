# My Personal Website (stevens.work)

- This website is strictly static for now.
- Utilizes Heroku's `Rack` [ruby gem](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/static-sites-ruby).
- [This](https://nameless-springs-52361.herokuapp.com) should mimick this GitHub repository.


### Design 
- Needs help
- Specifically more content


### Roadmap
- About me page
- An actual design
- Custom font!
-- I really like [this one](https://www.typewolf.com/site-of-the-day/manuel-sofia) and [this one](https://www.typewolf.com/site-of-the-day/fonts/apercu). They could be paired together.



Thanks for checking this out! Hope you enjoy -
